# Model-devrepo-showcase

Demonstration case

Showcase for training computer vision segmentaion model for real-near business case
Done:
- Data download & preprocessing pipelines
- Training & testing pipelines
- Prediction pipeline
- Export to ONNX
- Experiment versioning to filesystem or with comet.ml

TODO:
- Dockerize it and develop remote training script with RunPod API

Have plans to continue this showcase and develop production-ready computer vision system for real-time RTSP videostream segmentaion
